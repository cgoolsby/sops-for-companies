# SOPS for Companies - Enterprise Secrets Management

A production-ready implementation of SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) for managing encrypted secrets in a corporate environment with employee key management, role-based access control, and CI/CD integration.

## üîê Overview

This repository demonstrates best practices for using [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops) with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) encryption to manage secrets across multiple environments while maintaining security, auditability, and ease of use.

### Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate access levels for developers, administrators, and CI/CD
- **YAML Anchors**: Efficient key group management using YAML anchors in `.sops.yaml`
- **Employee Lifecycle Management**: Scripts for onboarding and offboarding employees
- **Secret Rotation**: Automated and manual secret rotation capabilities
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: CI/CD workflows for validation and deployment
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Separate secrets for dev, staging, and production
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all key and secret operations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Install SOPS:
```bash
# macOS
brew install sops

# Linux
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/latest/download/sops-v3.8.1.linux.amd64
sudo mv sops-v3.8.1.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
```

2. Install age:
```bash
# macOS
brew install age

# Linux
apt-get install age  # Debian/Ubuntu
# or download from https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/releases
```

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourcompany/sops-for-companies.git
cd sops-for-companies
```

2. Generate your age keypair:
```bash
age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
```

3. Share your public key with an administrator to get onboarded

4. Verify your access:
```bash
./scripts/verify-access.sh
```

## üë• Employee Management

### Onboarding a New Employee

Run the onboarding script as an administrator:

```bash
./scripts/onboard.sh
```

The script will:
1. Prompt for employee name and role (developer/administrator)
2. Accept an existing public key or generate a new keypair
3. Add the key to `.sops.yaml` with proper group assignment
4. Re-encrypt all secrets to include the new key
5. Commit changes with an audit trail

### Offboarding an Employee

```bash
./scripts/offboard.sh
```

The script will:
1. Remove the employee's key from `.sops.yaml`
2. Re-encrypt all secrets without the removed key
3. Optionally rotate sensitive secrets
4. Create an audit log entry
5. Commit all changes

## üîë Key Management

### Key Groups

The `.sops.yaml` file uses YAML anchors to define reusable key groups:

- **`&developers`**: Access to development secrets only
- **`&administrators`**: Access to all environments
- **`&ci`**: CI/CD service account with deployment access

### Access Matrix

| Role | Development | Staging | Production | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Developers | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Administrators | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| CI/CD | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

### Viewing Current Keys

```bash
./scripts/list-keys.sh
```

This displays:
- All configured keys grouped by role
- Access levels for each key
- Total statistics
- Last configuration update

## üîÑ Secret Management

### Creating a New Secret

1. Create a plaintext YAML file:
```yaml
# secrets/dev/new-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
data:
  api_key: "your-api-key"
  password: "your-password"
```

2. Encrypt it with SOPS:
```bash
sops -e secrets/dev/new-service.yaml > secrets/dev/new-service.enc.yaml
rm secrets/dev/new-service.yaml  # Remove plaintext
```

### Editing an Existing Secret

```bash
sops secrets/production/credentials.enc.yaml
```

This opens your default editor with the decrypted content. Changes are automatically re-encrypted on save.

### Rotating Secrets

Use the rotation script for automated rotation:

```bash
./scripts/rotate-secrets.sh
```

Options:
1. Rotate specific secret file
2. Rotate all secrets in an environment
3. Rotate all production secrets
4. View rotation history

### Viewing Decrypted Secrets

```bash
# View entire file
sops -d secrets/dev/database.enc.yaml

# Extract specific value
sops -d secrets/dev/database.enc.yaml | yq '.data.password'
```

## ü§ñ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Setup

1. Generate a CI/CD age keypair:
```bash
age-keygen -o ci-keys.txt
```

2. Add the private key to GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
   - Create `SOPS_AGE_KEY` with the private key value

3. Add the public key to `.sops.yaml` under the `ci` group

### Available Workflows

#### validate-secrets.yml
- Runs on every PR affecting secrets
- Validates encryption status
- Checks key references
- Security audit

#### deploy-secrets.yml
- Manual workflow for deploying secrets
- Supports multiple targets:
  - Kubernetes
  - AWS Secrets Manager
  - Azure Key Vault
  - HashiCorp Vault
- Requires environment approval

#### audit-keys.yml
- Weekly automated audit
- Checks for unused keys
- Validates access patterns
- Creates issues for problems

## üìä Utilities

### Verify Access

Test your decryption capabilities:

```bash
# Check all access
./scripts/verify-access.sh

# Test specific file
./scripts/verify-access.sh secrets/dev/database.enc.yaml
```

### List Keys

View current key configuration:

```bash
./scripts/list-keys.sh
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Key Storage

1. **Never commit private keys** to the repository
2. Store private keys in:
   - `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` (Linux/macOS)
   - Password manager for backup
   - Hardware security module (HSM) for production

### Secret Rotation

- Rotate secrets quarterly at minimum
- Immediate rotation after employee offboarding
- Automated rotation for dynamic secrets
- Document rotation in audit logs

### Access Control

- Follow principle of least privilege
- Separate production access from development
- Require multiple administrators (bus factor)
- Regular access audits

### Audit Trail

- All key changes are logged
- Git commits provide change history
- Offboarding audit log tracks removed access
- Rotation log documents secret changes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Cannot decrypt file"
- Verify your key is in `.sops.yaml`
- Check `SOPS_AGE_KEY` environment variable
- Ensure key file exists at expected location
- Run `./scripts/verify-access.sh` to diagnose

#### "Key not found in config"
- Your key needs to be added by an administrator
- Run `./scripts/onboard.sh` as admin

#### "Failed to re-encrypt"
- Check that all referenced keys are valid
- Verify no syntax errors in `.sops.yaml`
- Ensure all key groups are properly defined

### Getting Help

1. Check the scripts' built-in help
2. Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions
3. Examine audit logs for historical context
4. Contact your security team
